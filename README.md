# xoro_picture_manager

A script I wrote years ago for our Xoro CPF 10A1 digital picture frame.
Picks a directory, searches for pictures in it (and all subfolders)
and uploads a random selection of these via ADB.

I added a state file recently and decided I wanted to add it to a Git repo to
see its history. Maybe someone else will have a use for it too.

*It's not nice, it's organically grown, but it works.*
